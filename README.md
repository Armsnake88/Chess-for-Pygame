# Chess Game State Management

This code provides a basic framework for managing the state of a chess game. It includes the representation of the chessboard, the logic for moving pieces, and the ability to track and undo moves. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

## GameState Class

- **Board Representation**: The chessboard is represented as an 8x8 grid (a list of lists), where each element is a string representing a piece or an empty square. For example, `'bR'` represents a black rook, `'wp'` represents a white pawn, and `'--'` represents an empty square.

- **Turn Management**: The `white_to_move` attribute keeps track of whose turn it is to move. It starts as `True` for white's turn and toggles after each move.

- **Move Logging**: The `move_log` list stores all moves made during the game, allowing for undoing moves.

- **Undo Move**: The `undo_move` method allows the last move to be undone, restoring the board to its previous state and toggling the turn back.

- **Move Generation**: The `getValidMoves` method generates all possible moves for the current player, ignoring checks for simplicity. It calls `getAllPossibleMoves`, which iterates over the board and delegates move generation to specific methods based on the piece type (e.g., `getPawnMoves`, `getRookMoves`).

- **Piece-Specific Move Logic**: Currently, only pawn moves are implemented. The `getPawnMoves` method handles forward moves, captures, and the potential for a double move from the starting position. Other piece types (rook, queen, knight, king, bishop) have placeholders for future implementation.

- **Making Moves**: The `make_move` method checks if a move is valid and then executes it by updating the board and logging the move.

## Move Class

- **Move Representation**: A `Move` object represents a move from one square to another. It stores the starting and ending positions, the piece moved, and any piece captured.

- **Chess Notation**: The `get_chess_notation` method converts a move into standard [chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation) (e.g., "e2,e4").

- **Equality Check**: The `__eq__` method allows for comparing two moves to see if they are the same, based on their unique move ID.

This code provides a foundation for a chess game engine, focusing on the core mechanics of move generation and execution. Future enhancements could include implementing move logic for all piece types, handling special moves like [castling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling) and [en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant), and adding checks for legal moves (e.g., avoiding moves that leave the king in check).
